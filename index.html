        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>We are a team of dedicated students enrolled in the Web Client Development course (WEB CLIENT DEVELOPMENT 420-DW2-AS) for the Fall 2023 term. Our group has come together to collaborate on an exciting web development project.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project is a client-side web application that showcases our skills and knowledge gained throughout the course. It consists of several key components, including a login form, a questionnaire form featuring "The True Colors Personality Test," and a results display. Our primary goal is to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing web app that effectively utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including jQuery), and other relevant technologies.</p>

        <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
        <p>We follow technical specifications to ensure the success of our project, including the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) to display test results, personalizing the user experience with JavaScript session storage, and adhering to HTML standards. Our project includes a navigation menu, error handling, proper code formatting, standard file and directory names, and a readme file to document our progress.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>We are committed to delivering a high-quality web application that not only meets the course requirements but also demonstrates our passion for web client development. We aim to excel in the peer review process and impress both our instructors and fellow students with our final product.</p>
